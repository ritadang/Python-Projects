# Python-Projects

use NumPy array manipulation to perform simple image processing tasks.

# 1
b.jpg was removed from the center(horizontalandvertical) of a.jpg. Use slicing to put the image back together. Show the result on the screen and save it to c.jpg.

# 2
There are 9 differences between g.jpg and h.jpg. Use NumPy to reveal them by generating an image like i.jpg (below), show it on your screen, and save it to i.jpg. 

# 3
Replace the green background of e.jpg with a black background.
