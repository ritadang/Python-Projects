# Image Processing 

## use NumPy array manipulation to perform simple image processing tasks.

1. b.jpg was removed from the center(horizontalandvertical) of a.jpg. Use slicing to put the image back together. Show the result on the screen and save it to c.jpg.

2. There are 9 differences between g.jpg and h.jpg. Use NumPy to reveal them by generating an image like i.jpg (below), show it on your screen, and save it to i.jpg. 

3. Replace the green background of e.jpg with a black background. 

4. Write a function detect edge(im, method) that takes a gray-scale image and detects edges, with the option of horizontal, vertical or both.

# TkInter

## use TkInter to create an n × n knights tour puzzle game.

5. Your program should check if a move made by the user is valid or not. Highlight all the positions that have been visited before in blue, and the currently occupied square should be shown in orange. Read the wiki page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour to get more information on knight’s tour game. For simplicity, we assume that the knight is allowed to go back to positions that have been visited before. You are not required to do anything after the game ends (that is, when all the squares have been visited), but you are encouraged to make the game more interesting and user-friendly by including more features.
