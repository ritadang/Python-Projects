# Image Processing with Python

## use NumPy array manipulation to perform simple image processing tasks.

1. b.jpg was removed from the center(horizontalandvertical) of a.jpg. Use slicing to put the image back together. Show the result on the screen and save it to c.jpg.

2. There are 9 differences between g.jpg and h.jpg. Use NumPy to reveal them by generating an image like i.jpg (below), show it on your screen, and save it to i.jpg. 

3. Replace the green background of e.jpg with a black background. 

4. Write a function detect edge(im, method) that takes a gray-scale image and detects edges, with the option of horizontal, vertical or both.
